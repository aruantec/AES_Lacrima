# AES Lacrima
AES stands for **“Aruan's Entertainment Software”**, formerly known as **@ES** in a small emulation community, and is a personal research project as well as an emulation frontend and multimedia app created with the awesome Avalonia UI Framework.

@ES was created for the same reason that is currently being revived. 17 years ago, I set myself the challenge of mastering WPF and pushing it to its limits as far as possible. It was no easy task, and just like today, I had to deal with several obstacles that I had to overcome in order to move forward.<br />

Below in my channel, you can see a brief history of the project from 17 years ago(sort by oldest).<br />

**NOTE**:<br />
The current status does not yet correspond to the videos, as I am pushing the content bit by bit while I clean and organize everything in my spare time. The purpose is to show what it looks like in its actual state of development.

Supports Plasma6 Wallpaper(Shadertoy/Fragment) Shaders. Simply copy the *.frag files to Shaders/Shadertoys.<br />

Some of the included shaders react to the music by using the player's spectrum data. This is currently done for demonstration purposes, and the Shadertoy control itself allows you to disable this feature by simply removing the spectrum binding.
