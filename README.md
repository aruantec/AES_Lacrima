# AES Lacrima
AES stands for **“Aruan's Entertainment Software”** and is a personal research project as well as an emulation frontend and multimedia app created with the awesome Avalonia UI Framework.

**NOTE**:<br />
The current status does not yet correspond to the videos, as I am pushing the content bit by bit while I clean and organize everything in my spare time. The purpose is to show what it looks like in its actual state of development.

Supports Plasma6 Wallpaper(Shadertoy/Fragment) Shaders. Simply copy the *.frag files to Shaders/Shadertoys.<br />
